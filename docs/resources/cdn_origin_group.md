# yandex_cdn_origin_group (Resource)

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new CDN Origin Group
//
resource "yandex_cdn_origin_group" "my_group" {
  name     = "My Origin group"
  use_next = true

  origin {
    source = "ya.ru"
  }

  origin {
    source = "yandex.ru"
  }

  origin {
    source = "goo.gl"
  }

  origin {
    source = "amazon.com"
    backup = false
  }
}
```

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.my_cdn_group ...
```
