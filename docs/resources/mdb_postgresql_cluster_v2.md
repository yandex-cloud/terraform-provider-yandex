# yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster_v2 (Resource)

Manages a PostgreSQL cluster within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/managed-postgresql/). [How to connect to the DB](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-postgresql/quickstart#connect). To connect, use port 6432. The port number is not configurable.

## Example Usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new MDB PostgreSQL Cluster (v2).
//
resource "yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster_v2" "my_v2_cluster" {
  name        = "test"
  environment = "PRESTABLE"
  network_id  = yandex_vpc_network.foo.id

  config {
    version = 17
    resources {
      resource_preset_id = "s2.micro"
      disk_type_id       = "network-ssd"
      disk_size          = 16
    }
    postgresql_config = {
      max_connections                = 395
      enable_parallel_hash           = true
      autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.34
      default_transaction_isolation  = "TRANSACTION_ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED"
      shared_preload_libraries       = "SHARED_PRELOAD_LIBRARIES_AUTO_EXPLAIN,SHARED_PRELOAD_LIBRARIES_PG_HINT_PLAN"
    }
  }

  maintenance_window = {
    type = "WEEKLY"
    day  = "SAT"
    hour = 12
  }

  hosts = {
    "host1d" = {
      zone      = "ru-central1-d"
      subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.foo.id
    }
  }
}

// Auxiliary resources
resource "yandex_vpc_network" "foo" {}

resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "foo" {
  zone           = "ru-central1-d"
  network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.foo.id
  v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.5.0.0/24"]
}
```

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster_v2.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster_v2.my_v2_cluster ...
```
